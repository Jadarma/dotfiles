# CLI VISUALIZER
#
# Config for a cool sound visualizer to play in your terminal with. This file
# has been scraped down to contain just settings I deemed important. For a more
# complete example configuration, visit the official repo.
#
# @see https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer/blob/master/examples/config
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Refresh rate of the visualizers. A really high refresh rate may cause screen tearing. Default is 20.
visualizer.fps=60

# Sets the audio sources to use.
# Currently available ones are "mpd", "pulse" and "alsa". Defaults to "mpd".
audio.sources=pulse

# vis tries to find the correct pulseaudio sink, however this will not work on all systems.
# If pulse audio is not working with vis try switching the audio source. A list can be found by running the
# command pacmd list-sinks  | grep -e 'name:'  -e 'index'.
# audio.pulse.source=0

# If set to false the visualizers will use mono mode instead of stereo. Some visualizers will
# behave differently when mono is enabled. For example, spectrum show two sets of bars.
audio.stereo.enabled=true

# Configures the samples rate and the cutoff frequencies.
audio.sampling.frequency=44100
audio.low.cutoff.frequency=20
audio.high.cutoff.frequency=17000

# Configures the visualizers and the order they are in. Available visualizers are spectrum,lorenz,ellipse.
# Defaults to spectrum,ellipse,lorenz.
visualizers=spectrum

# Spectrum bar width. Defaults to 2.
visualizer.spectrum.bar.width=2

# The amount of space between each bar in the spectrum visualizer. Defaults to 1.
# It's possible to set this to zero to have no space between bars.
visualizer.spectrum.bar.spacing=1

# Available smoothing options are monstercat, sgs, none.
visualizer.spectrum.smoothing.mode=sgs

# This configures the falloff effect on the spectrum visualizer. Available falloff options are fill,top,none.
# Defaults to "fill"
visualizer.spectrum.falloff.mode=fill

# Reverses the direction of the spectrum so that high freqs are first and low freqs last. Defaults to false.
visualizer.spectrum.reversed=false

# This configures the sgs smoothing effect on the spectrum visualizer. More points spreads out the smoothing
# effect and increasing passes runs the smoother multiple times on reach run. Defaults are points=3 and passes=1.
visualizer.sgs.smoothing.points=3
visualizer.sgs.smoothing.passes=1

# Turns off overriding the user's terminal colors. This is true by default.
colors.override.terminal=true

# Specifies the color scheme. The color scheme must be in ~/.config/vis/colors/ directory. The default scheme is "colors".
colors.scheme=oceanic
