# Jadarma's Dotfiles {docsify-ignore-all}

Welcome! This is a documentation / written tutorial for my dotfiles repo. 

***(This section is still under construction.)***

> [!WARNING]
> The dotfile repo is still in "early" development stage.
> 
> While providing _mostly_ a usable system out of the box, some functionality might still be missing, as this setup is
> transitioning from being on top of an existing Manjaro installation to its standalone Arch install.
